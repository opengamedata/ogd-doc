% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section[Event Theory]{Theory of Event Identification}

\begin{frame}{Event Categories}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    // Describe the categories of events: player actions, system feedback, progression
    \pause
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section[Walkthrough]{Game Walkthrough}

\subsection[Schema Files]{Game Schema Files}

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  % Keep the summary *very short*.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
