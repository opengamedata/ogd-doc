# Changes in the Second-Order Features update

A number of major changes and updates have been made to the way new Features are added in OpenGameData.

First, a few renamings that are made for consistency:

- Previously, each game had a folder called `extractors`, which contained all the Feature classes.
  This folder has been renamed to `features`.

- 

Next, this is the second-order feature architecture itself.
