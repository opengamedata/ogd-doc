Unit 2: Game Event Logging
========================================

This unit begins with a description of the `Event` data type in the OpenGameData tools and libraries.
This is covered in chapter 1, which should give you a full understanding of what events are within OpenGameData, and how to interpret and work with event data from a game.
Chapters 2 and 3 describe the process of adding event logging to an existing game.
