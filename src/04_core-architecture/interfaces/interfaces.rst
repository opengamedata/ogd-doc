Architecture Chapter 2: Interfaces & Outerfaces
===============================================

OpenGameData uses classes called ``connectors`` to load input data and write output data.
To clarify between the two, we use the word ``interface`` for ``connectors`` that perform **in**put, and ``outerface`` for any that do **out**put.
