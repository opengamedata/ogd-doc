## `utils` Module

The ``utils`` module contains various classes and submodules that do not fit cleanly into a specific category, but are useful across tools and other modules.

### File I/O

The `fileio` submodule contains a client-side interface for the OpenGameData file API, as well as loading JSON-formatted files.

### Helpers

The ``helpers`` submodule contains various helper functions left over from previous analyses; these may be deprecated and removed in the future.

### Logger

The ``Logger`` class is used across OpenGameData to provide nicely-formatted error/debug prints.

### Readme

The ``Readme`` class is used to generate readme files for exports and related operations, through Markdown generated by schemas and configs.

### Typing

The ``typing`` module contains typedefs that are used across OpenGameData, but do not have an equivalent (that we know of) in the built-in Python ``typing`` module.
