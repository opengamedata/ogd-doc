## Contributing to OpenGameData

We are always looking for people to contribute their work back to the main OpenGameData project.
If you have added new features or fixed issues in any of the OpenGameData tools, whether in a fork or local Git clone, we invite you to submit a pull request through the corresponding GitHub repository.
