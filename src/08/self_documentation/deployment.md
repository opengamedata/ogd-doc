## Deployment

The documentation is deployed to our [readthedocs](https://opengamedata-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) site after building.
Further, the project is configured via webhook to rebuild and deploy every time changes are pushed to the `opengamedata-doc` GitHub project.
Configuration of the **readthedocs** build process lives in the `.readthedocs.yaml` file (see [here](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html) for **rtd**'s config documentation)
