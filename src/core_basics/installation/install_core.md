## Installation

Before you can use OpenGameData, you'll need to install a couple tools.
First, OpenGameData is implemented in Python, which means you'll need a Python interpreter to run the code, which in turn means you need to have Python installed on your system.

Second, you must determine whether you will run OpenGameData from an installed Python package, or from a local source copy.

### Install OpenGameData

#### Installation as Package

#### Installation as Local Source Copy

Second, the OpenGameData source code is hosted on the [GitHub website](www.github.com/opengamedata/).
GitHub is built for use with `Git`, a popular version control system we use for source control and distribution.
While it is possible to download and use the **`OpenGameData`** source without `Git`, we strongly recommend using `Git` to obtain the source.
This will allow you to track any changes you make, and to optionally contribute your changes back to the **`OpenGameData`** community.  
We *strongly* recommend [installing and using Git](#install-git) so that you can keep your OpenGameData code up-to-date, and participate in the OpenGameData community by contributing your innovations back the public.

##### Download or Clone OpenGameData

##### Install Python Libraries

### Other Tools

#### Install Git

This step is necessary if you would like to submit changes back to the OpenGameData community for inclusion in the public repository.

We do not specify a minimum (or maximum) recommended version of `Git` to use.
You can obtain a `Git` installer from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.  
If you are not comfortable working from a command line, consider downloading an installer for a GUI client (included in the linked page above).
