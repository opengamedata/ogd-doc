## Documenting OpenGameData

<!-- Move to self_documentation/self_documentation.md -->

Inevitably, for any sufficiently large project, a few words of that project's documentation must be spent describing how the project is documented.
This section of the **OpenGameData** (**OGD**) documentation does just that.

The tech stack for the `opengamedata-doc` project can be roughly broken down as follows:

- Storage : **GitHub**
- Build : **Sphinx**
- Deployment : **readthedocs** (**rtd**)
- Implementation : **reStructuredText** (**ReST**) and **Markdown**
