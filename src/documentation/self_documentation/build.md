## Build

We use the **Sphinx** system to build the `opengamedata-doc` documentation from source into a usable HTML website.
The **Sphinx** build process is configured in `source/conf.py`
There's nothing particularly special about our configuration, but you can read about **Sphinx** configuration generally on the [sphinx-doc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html) website.

We use several **Sphinx** extensions to support building various implementation languages into our documentation.
We will link to individual extensions' pages as they are discussed below; for general information on **Sphinx** extensions, see the sphinx-doc [extensions page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/)
