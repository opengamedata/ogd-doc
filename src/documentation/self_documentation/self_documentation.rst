Meta-Documentation Chapter 1: Self-Documentation
================================================

Inevitably, for any sufficiently large project, a few words of that project's documentation must be spent describing how the project is documented.
This section of the **OpenGameData** (**OGD**) documentation does just that.

The tech stack for the `opengamedata-doc` project can be roughly broken down as follows:

* Storage : **GitHub**
* Implementation : **reStructuredText** (**ReST**) and **Markdown**
* Build : **Sphinx**
* Deployment : **readthedocs** (**rtd**)

.. mdinclude:: ./self_documentation.md

.. mdinclude:: ./storage.md

.. mdinclude:: ./implementation.md

.. mdinclude:: ./build.md

.. mdinclude:: ./deployment.md
