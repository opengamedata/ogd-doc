## Storage

The documentation source is stored in a project [GitHub](https://github.com/opengamedata/opengamedata-doc).
There's not a lot else to say about this.
If you don't have experience with **Git**, you might start with the [git-scm docs](https://git-scm.com/doc).
From there, you can learn about the services offered by **GitHub** with its [getting started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) guide.
