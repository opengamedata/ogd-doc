# Getting Started

This document will help you to set up the **`OpenGameData`** data exporting tools, and to run your first data export.
There are two options for getting and running **`OpenGameData`**:

1. Virtualized with `Docker`
2. Running **`OpenGameData`** locally

We will describe each of these approaches in this document:

## Running **`OpenGameData`** Locally in `Python`

## Installation

The first step is to obtain the **`OpenGameData`** code that you can execute on your local machine.
There are a few prerequisite pieces of software you must have:

1. `Git`
2. `Python`

We use `Git` for source control and distribution.
While it is possible to download and use the **`OpenGameData`** source without `Git`, we strongly recommend using `Git` to obtain the source.
This will allow you to track any changes you make, and to optionally contribute your changes back to the **`OpenGameData`** community.  
`Python` is the language in which **`OpenGameData`** is written, and must be installed in order for you to run **`OpenGameData`** locally.

### Installing `Git`

We do not specify a minimum (or maximum) recommended version of `Git` to use.
You can obtain a `Git` installer from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.  
If you are not comfortable working from a command line, consider downloading an installer for a GUI client (included in the linked page above).
