# OpenGameData Documentation Welcome

Welcome to the OpenGameData Documentation Project.
This website will, at some point, describe all aspects of the OpenGameData tools for collecting, processing, analyzing, and distributing event-based data from educational games and game-like interactive digital media.

We recommend you check the [getting started](./getting_started.md) page to determine which of the many use-cases supported by the OpenGameData tools apply to you, and by extension, which parts of this website you should read.
The rest of this page will introduce you to the structure of our documentation, as well as the variety of tools available from OpenGameData.

## Documentation Organization

The OpenGameData documentation is broken down into 8 *Units*, plus the "Unit 0" containing this introductory material.
Each unit is made up of several chapters.
Together, the units describe all parts of the OpenGameData infrastructure.

The units are as follows:

2. [Event Data](../events/index.rst):  
    A discussion of the OpenGameData Event Schema, and the several software packages used to collect event data.
3. [Detectors & Feature Engineering](../features/index.rst):  
    How to write data Generators in OpenGameData Core to create refined analytics from raw event data.
4. [Core Architecture](../architecture/index.rst):  
    A comprehensive review of the data processing architecture in OpenGameData Core, including how to integrate Core components into your own 3rd-party tool(s).
5. [OpenGameData APIs](../apis/index.rst):  
    Documentation of the OpenGameData APIs for data storage and access.
6. [Data Analysis & Visualization Tools](../analysis/index.rst):  
    An introduction to OpenGameData-based tools for data analysis, including Jupyter Notebook templates and data dashboards.
7. [Meta-Documentation](../meta_documentation/index.rst):
