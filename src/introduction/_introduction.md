## Overview

Welcome to the OpenGameData Documentation Project.

This first unit gives you a basic overview of the project as a whole.
The [first chapter](./chapter_01/index.rst) presents a summary of the project and overall organization of the documentation site.
The second chapter covers [getting started](./chapter_02/index.rst) in OpenGameData.
It is intended to help you determine which of the many use-cases supported by the OpenGameData tools apply to you, and by extension, which parts of the documentation you should read.
