## Welcome

Welcome to the OpenGameData Project!
This website will, at some point, describe all aspects of the OpenGameData tools for collecting, processing, analyzing, and distributing event-based data from educational games and game-like interactive digital media.

## Documentation Organization

The OpenGameData documentation is broken down into 9 *Units*, plus the library API reference docs.
Each unit is made up of several chapters.
Together, the units describe all parts of the OpenGameData infrastructure.

The units are as follows:

<!-- TODO : update links here -->

1. [Introduction & Organization](./index.rst):  
    An overview of the OpenGameData project and documentation.
2. [OpenGameData Core Basics](../unit_02/index.rst):  
    The basics of using OpenGameData Core, including configuration and basic data exports.
3. [Data Types and Logging](../unit_03/index.rst):  
    A discussion of the OpenGameData Event Schema, and the several software packages used to collect event data.
4. [Detectors & Feature Engineering](../unit_04/index.rst):  
    How to write data Generators in OpenGameData Core to create refined analytics from raw event data.
5. [Core Architecture](../unit_05/index.rst):

8. [Data Analysis & Visualization Tools](../unit_08/index.rst):  
    An introduction to OpenGameData-based tools for data analysis, including Jupyter Notebook templates and data dashboards.
9. [Meta-Documentation](../unit_09/index.rst):  
    Documentation for contributors working on core OGD infrastructure and documentation, covering topics such as coding conventions and our software reference platform.
10. [Core API Reference](../reference/index.rst):
