## OpenGameData Use-Cases

I need to...

* [Retrieve a Dataset from my OpenGameData Data Source](#retrieve-a-dataset-from-my-opengamedata-data-source)
* [Integrate a new Game with OpenGameData](#integrate-a-new-game-with-opengamedata)
* [Integrate a new Data Source with OpenGameData](#integrate-a-new-data-source-with-opengamedata)
* [Perform Feature Engineering on my Raw Event Data](#perform-feature-engineering-on-my-raw-event-data)
* [Perform OpenGameData Processing in my 3rd-Party Tool](#perform-opengamedata-processing-in-my-3rd-party-tool)

### Retrieve a Dataset from my OpenGameData Data Source

<!-- TODO : update the many, many links here -->

You should read the following portions of the documentation in order to retrieve a dataset:

1. Start by [installing OpenGameData](../unit_02/chapter_01/index.rst).
    * When choosing between a "Package" and "Local Source" install, you should choose the ["Package" option](../unit_02/chapter_01/index.rst#installation-as-package)
        * autolink for the link above: <project:../unit_02/chapter_01/index.rst#installation-as-package>
2. If the game whose data you want to retrieve has not previously been added to OpenGameData, you should instead begin with Step 2 of [integrating a new game](#integrate-a-new-game-with-opengamedata).
    * Follow the remaining steps as needed, and return to this spot.
3. Check your [OpenGameData configuration](../unit_02/chapter_02/index.rst)
4. Perform your [dataset export](../unit_02/chapter_03/index.rst)

### Integrate a new Game with OpenGameData

You should read the following portions of the documentation in order to integrate a new game with OpenGameData.:

1. Start by [adding event logging](../unit_03/index.rst) to your game.  
    * This chapter will walk you through the process of using the logging client and server to capture event data, optionally setting up a new OpenGameData data source.
2. Next, [install OpenGameData](../unit_02/chapter_01/index.rst).
    * When choosing between a "Package" and "Local Source" install, you should choose the ["Local Source" option](../unit_02/chapter_01/index.rst#installation-as-local-source-copy)
3. Finally, [add a configuration](../unit_02/chapter_02/index.rst)
