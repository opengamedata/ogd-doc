## Unit 1: OpenGameData Core Basics

This unit introduces you to the basic operation of the OpenGameData "core" processing pipeline, which is usually, but not always, installed as a Python library called `opengamedata-core`.
The first chapter explains your installation options, while the second and third chapters walk you through configuration and exporting data through the pipeline.
Finally, chapter 4 links you to other resources related to the core pipeline.

Later units build on this chapter to explain how to extend the pipeline with your own event detectors, feature extractors, or model builders.
