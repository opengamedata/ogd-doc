## Overview

This unit introduces the ideas of game telemetry events, and how to work with this event data, which is fundamental to the OpenGameData infrastructure.

It begins with a description of the `Event` data type used by the various OpenGameData tools and libraries.
This is covered in chapter 1, which should give you a full understanding of what events are within OpenGameData, and how to interpret and work with event data from a game.
Chapters 2 and 3 describe the process of adding event logging to an existing game.
