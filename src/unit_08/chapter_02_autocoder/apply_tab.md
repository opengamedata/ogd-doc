# Apply Tab

In the apply tab, you perform the revision of the labels that were output by the model.


## Navigation
The `Predicted Label` control is the output of the model and the `Confidence` is the approximation of the model's certainty of this label, going from 0 as lowest and 1 as highest.

**Apply** button applies the predicted label to the segment.\
**Reject** button skips to the next segment, without assigning any label.

These buttons have **counts** on each of them that count number of times the button was pressed.
